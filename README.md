## 📍 Overview

It is a project I did with a friend, she did the design and I coded the website. The intention was to simulate a Client/Developer experience and get as close to what the client wanted as possible.

I was free to use any technologies I wanted, but I wanted to fine-tune the basics and went with HTML/CSS/JS stack alongside Firebase which I used for hosting and auth.

## 📦 Features

- The Pomodoro logic is quite simple to understand, but I tried adding some customization to give the end user more control and personalization.
- I played a little with animation to get that timer animation working and synching with the timer.
- The Firebase integration was quite straightforward although I faced some unusual errors but nothing was impossible.
- Getting the grasp over the Flexbox
- Small transition here and there

## TODOS

This project isn't 100% done actually its not even fully usable as of now (10/10/2023):

- There are like 0 tests.
- It still needs more transitions and fluidity.
- There are some bugs here and there like when you skip all the pomos it doesn't restart.
- This website isn't responsive nor adaptive, It was developed for large 1080p screens and Chromium browsers.
- The auth isn't quite there either, there isn't enough logic or security except for the one provided by Firebase.
